## 🎨 Design

The application features dynamic theming that adapts to each NHL team's unique colors. Each team has a custom color palette including:
- **Primary Color** - Team's main brand color for accents and highlights
- **Secondary Color** - Complementary team color for additional accents
- **Background Colors** - Dark, professional backgrounds optimized for data display
- **Foreground Colors** - High-contrast text colors for excellent readability

The default theme is based on the Vegas Golden Knights colors (Steel Gray and Gold), but changes dynamically when you select a different team.

Typography uses the **Inter** font family for excellent readability across all data displays.

## 🔄 Data Sources

All live data is fetched from the official NHL API:
- Player statistics for the current season (points, goals, assists, plus/minus, shifts, goalie stats)
- Upcoming game schedules with real-time scores
- Team information, standings, and conference positions
- Complete team rosters with player positions

External data sources:
- **PuckPedia** - Injury reports and salary cap information

Data is cached for 24 hours to reduce API load and improve performance.
